# Mini Benchmark Suite

## Purpose

This repository provides **mini benchmarks** to characterize the **fundamental performance
capabilities of HPC compute nodes**. The goal is to establish **clean, reproducible baselines**
that define *what the system can deliver*, independent of any application.

These baselines are used for:
- system validation and health checks
- performance regression detection
- input to performance models and schedulers
- interpretation of application behavior
